/* Project 7: Random Fact Generator

Description: In this project, you will create a simple program that retrieves a random fact from
an array of facts using either promises or async/await and displays it in the console when the
user runs the program.
Instructions:
1. Start by creating an array of at least 10 random facts.
2. Create a function called getRandomFact that selects a random fact from the array and
returns it.
3. In your getRandomFact function, use setTimeout to simulate a delay of 1-3 seconds to
make it seem like the fact is being retrieved asynchronously.
4. Create an async function called displayRandomFact that calls the getRandomFact
function and logs the fact to the console using console.log.
5. In your displayRandomFact function, use either promises or async/await to retrieve the
fact asynchronously.
6. Finally, call the displayRandomFact function to display a random fact in the console
when the user runs the program.

    "Bananas are berries, but strawberries are not",
    "A group of flamingos is called a flamboyance",
    "The longest river in the world is the Nile",
    "The shortest war in history was between Zanzibar and the United Kingdom in 1896. Zanzibar surrendered after just 38 minutes.",
    "A cat can make over 100 different sounds",
    "The Earth has more than 8,000 known species of ants",
    "The longest word in the English language is 189,819 letters long",
    "The human nose can detect over 1 trillion smells",
    "There is a species of jellyfish that is immortal"
