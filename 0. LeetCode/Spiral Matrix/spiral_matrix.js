/* Certainly! Here are the steps for traversing a matrix in a clockwise spiral pattern:

4. Traverse the top row from left to right (from `startCol` to `endCol`), appending each element to the output array.
5. Increment `startRow` to move to the next row.
6. Traverse the last column from top to bottom (from `startRow` to `endRow`), appending each element to the output array.
7. Decrement `endCol` to move to the previous column.
8. Check if `startRow` is still less than or equal to `endRow` to avoid duplicating elements when the number of rows is odd.
   - If true, traverse the bottom row from right to left (from `endCol` to `startCol` in reverse), appending each element to the output array.
   - Decrement `endRow` to move to the previous row.
9. Check if `startCol` is still less than or equal to `endCol` to avoid duplicating elements when the number of columns is odd.
   - If true, traverse the first column from bottom to top (from `endRow` to `startRow` in reverse), appending each element to the output array.
   - Increment `startCol` to move to the next column.
10. Repeat steps 4-9 until the entire matrix is traversed.
11. Return the output array.

By following these steps, you should be able to traverse a given matrix in a clockwise spiral pattern and obtain the desired output. */
